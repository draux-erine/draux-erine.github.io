                        After obtaining my Higher National Diploma, I joined the ENSEEIHT's Computer Science department
                        through an apprenticeship program. It represents a valuable opportunity to simultaneously deepen
                        my
                        theoretical knowledge and discover the professional world.
                        The curriculum covers various subjects : programming fundamentals, theoretical base of data
                        science, applied mathematics, the essential concepts of system design and finally networks.

                    <p>
                        In 2023, I enrolled in an IUT (University Institute of Technology) at the University of Toulouse
                        for a program which was originally designed as a three-year Professional Bachelor's degree
                        (BUT). However, after
                        two years, I chose to exit the program, thereby successfully obtaining the DUT,
                        which is recognized internationally as a Higher National Diploma in order to get
                        into ENSEEIHT. Following a generalized first year, I specialized in AGED (Administration,
                        Exploitation, and Management of Databases). While this specialization was primarily focused on
                        database administration and Data Science principles, the curriculum was structured to maintain
                        essential versatility. It included targeted courses in networking and sevelopment, which ensured
                        I acquired technical foundations while simultaneously developing skills crucial for
                        full-stack data projects.

                        <p>Many subjects in the world of computer science arouse my curiosity, one of them is Big Data.
                            Indeed, I find fascinating how valuable insights we can get from massive volumes of data. I
                            had
                            the chance to start discovering this subject during my years at the University by cleaning
                            and
                            re-organizing data to create PowerBI reports. It motivated me to continue on this path.
                            However,
                            big data is a large domain and currently, I am discovering the world of Data Science thanks
                            to my
                            apprenticeship. I still have a lot to learn, but I am eager to discover more about it and
                            eventually improve myself on subjects such as Artificial Intelligence. </p>

                <p>One of my key strengths is perseverance. Indeed, I always find ways to reach my goal no matter the
                    difficulty I have to overcome. This trait is particularly demonstrated in the academic
                    and learning environment. Let’s take for example my first year of University : it was the first time
                    for
                    me discovering the programming language ADA and focusing truly on algorithmics. It was very hard for
                    me
                    to adjust and I failed my first project and exam in this subject. However I didn’t let it get to me
                    and
                    saw this as a way to prove myself. In order to improve myself, I decided to re-do all of the TP and
                    to
                    ask for advice from my professors and classmates which led me to a better understanding of the
                    mechanics behind
                    this subject and I finally passed the second exam. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="strenght str2">
                <div class="strenghts-left">
                    <img src="images/collaboration.png">
                    <h2> Teamwork </h2>
                </div>
                <p>Another one of my strengths is teamwork and collaboration. This strength was particularly
                    demonstrated
                    during the “Nuit de l’Info”, a contest in which, as a team, we have to tackle computing challenges
                    in one
                    night. I participated in two editions : 2023 and 2024. The 2024 edition, however, was the most
                    notable in terms of collaboration.
                    Indeed, we were a team of six Computer Science students, and in order to be
                    effective, we started by brainstorming after reading the subject and the different challenges. This
                    allowed us to make sure everyone had the same understanding of the theme and to choose the
                    challenges we wanted to tackle. Once done, we decided to split the group : two of us, including me,
                    worked on a
                    playful captcha, three other members worked on the main challenge and the challenge that seemed
                    easier to us was tackled later during the night by one of the three group members. Of course, during
                    the
                    night I didn’t hesitate to ask for help when I faced difficulties and reciprocally, I also helped
                    my teammates and answered their questions or confusion.
                    In the end, we finished first for one challenge and on the podium for another one. It proved that we
                    succeeded in working in a group and collaborating even within a short period of time and under a lot
                    of pressure. </p>

                                    The purpose of this project was to clean, and analyse data of an open database:
                                    OpenFoodFact by making reports to give precise insights on Nutri-Score. Once done,
                                    another aim was to use Machine Learning processes on Knime to determine the
                                    Nutri-Score of certain products. The main difficulty resided in managing a vast
                                    dataset characterized by a significant number of incomplete entries and missing
                                    values, which presented a major challenge to delivering relevant and proper
                                    analyses.

                                        Our analysis revealed several key insights about the factors influencing
                                        Nutri-Score ratings :

                                        This infographic shows that products with many additives usually have poor
                                        Nutri-Scores (mostly D or E), while products without additives tend to score
                                        better. It also highlights that non-nutritive sweeteners are linked to higher
                                        Nutri-Scores because they add almost no calories.

                                    <p>
                                        The impact of packaging and labels on nutritional quality was also studied.
                                        Plastic and sachet packaging contained proportionally more products with poor
                                        Nutri-Scores (D and E). Likewise, most “positive” labels (such as Sustainable
                                        Trade or Vegetarian/Vegan) did not correspond to better nutritional quality and
                                        were often linked to low Nutri-Scores. Howerver labels related to composition or
                                        production such as Organic or Reduced Fat/Sugar showed a more balanced
                                        nutritional profile and higher Nutri-Score.

                                    My role was polyvalent throughout the project. Indeed, I actively participated in
                                    the design of the Conceptual Data Model (CDM), ensuring the data structure was
                                    optimized for our analysis. I then took the initiative to deepen my skills by
                                    handling the data cleaning and integration into the database, where I evaluated
                                    different approaches using both Python scripts and Knime workflows to determine
                                    which
                                    one was more practical for me.
                                    Furthermore, I was made responsible for creating the analysis reports on the impact
                                    of labels and packaging on the Nutri-Score. Facing the challenge of a large volume
                                    of incomplete entries and missing values, I demonstrated rigor and a
                                    problem-solving mindset by implementing filtering strategies to overcome this
                                    problem
                                    and successfully deliver reliable insights. Finally, I
                                    collaborated in the modeling phase by using distincts Machine Learning
                                    processes on Knime for Nutri-Score prediction. This project not only developed my
                                    technical skills but also enhanced my transversal skills, especially my autonomy
                                    when
                                    dealing with raw data, my problem-solving ability, and my team spirit.

                                    I used both Python and Knime for scripting and data cleaning, and for
                                    advanced data integration, processing, and the application of Machine Learning
                                    models, I used the visual workflow platform Knime. The data itself was
                                    sourced from the OpenFoodFacts API,
                                    structured using the Conceptual Data Model (CDM) methodology, and managed within a
                                    PostgreSQL database. For predictive modeling, I evaluated differents
                                    Machine Learning algorithms, including Gradient Boosted Trees and Multi-Layer
                                    Perceptron, to predict the Nutri-Score. Finally, Power BI was used for data
                                    visualization and the creation of detailed analytical reports.

                                The core challenge of this project was to conceive and develop a real estate management
                                application based on client expectations and specifications. The initial difficulty laid
                                in
                                the analysis of the subject and needs, which required many exchanges with the client to
                                fully grasp the complex business rules of the real estate sector. This led to the
                                fundamental necessity of defining a clear Conceptual Data Model (CDM), which served as
                                the
                                essential blueprint for the application's implementation.

                                I was an active member of a five-person development team, and my involvement covered the
                                entire project, from the initial subject analysis to the final application delivery. In
                                the planning phase, I worked with a teammate to define the User Stories and establish
                                the functional specifications, making sure all user scenarios matched our application’s
                                requirements. From a programming perspective, I was responsible for developing several
                                key features focused primarily on the View and Controller (MVC) layers. This included
                                creating the functionalities to create, display, and list buildings and various company
                                types (such as construction, repair, and insurance companies). I also implemented
                                important financial logic, including the ability to add expense provisions when creating
                                new properties and generating the complete expense summary report. Furthermore, I
                                designed and built the dedicated window for managing (adding or deleting) insurance
                                policies. Finally, I contributed to continuous code improvement efforts to maintain
                                quality, and I was essential in producing the final user guide.

                                For the application's development we developed in Java (within the Eclipse IDE). We
                                employed several best practices for code structuring to ensure high maintainability and clarity.
                                Most notably, we implemented the Data Access Object (DAO) design pattern. This technical
                                approach was key to achieving a clear and clean separation between the business logic layer and
                                the underlying data management layer, allowing for a highly modular and organized codebase.
                                We also chose to follow the Model-View-Controller architecture in order to

                        <p>
                            The company’s redundancy system experienced data inconsistencies during server failover. The
                            main goal of this internship was therefore to enhance the system resilience. My mission
                            involved identifying and implementing a database replication solution.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In the end, I successfully identified two viable data replication solutions suitable for the
                            company's two-server infrastructure. The initial research and testing phase resulted in the
                            elimination of multiple incompatible tools (including specific database and synchronization
                            mechanisms), which defined the final scope of deployment. I then focused on the
                            implementation of one solution, creating the necessary Java integration code and performing
                            functional tests to confirm its ability to replicate data and maintain consistency during
                            failover events. I delivered a comprehensive technical analysis, code samples, and
                            architectural diagrams. These materials provide the internal team with the practical
                            groundwork required to deploy the chosen replication system, ensuring the coherence of
                            critical alarm data and supporting service availability.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My role during this three-month internship was centered on improving data consistency in the
                            redundant server environment. I was responsible for conducting the comparative study and
                            hands-on testing of various database replication solutions. After selecting the most
                            suitable mechanisms, my primary contribution involved developing the Java code for a to
                            integrate the chosen system with the existing application architecture. I ensured detailed
                            documentation of the findings and the implementation steps, delivering the technical
                            foundation for the project’s next phase.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This project required applying and expanding expertise across several key technologies. The
                            implementation was conducted entirely within a Linux environment, utilizing Ubuntu Virtual
                            Machines for system setup and testing. I gained hands-on experience with several database
                            technologies including MongoDB, SQLite, and Redis, and focused heavily on evaluating various
                            data replication mechanisms (Master-Replica models). The integration work involved Java
                            development (utilizing class diagrams and adhering to best practices) to interface with the
                            core application. For advanced troubleshooting, I used Wireshark for deep TCP exchange
                            analysis, and relied on application logs and tools like JConsole to monitor system behavior
                            and validate data consistency.

            <h3 class="csr-subtitle"> Why is it important</h3>
            <p> In my opinion, the importance of CSR in engineering is significant. Indeed, CSR commitments allow us to
                step outside of our comfort zone and technical world in order to be more considerate of other factors
                such as ethical, social or environmental ones.
                By doing so, we are able to build our sense of responsibility and thus able to create solutions more
                adapted
                and relevant to the world we live in. For me, it's also what makes us more unique because each one of us
                will take part in distinct CSR commitments and experience
                it in a different way, leading to learning more about who we are and the engineer we want to become.

                                and provided a clear perspective on how intelligent systems are reshaping urban
                                movement. I
                                observed practical demonstrations of autonomous delivery
                                robots capable of navigating complex spaces and smart public transport solutions,
                                including the development of an autonomous campus shuttle. A key takeaway was
                                understanding the importance of integrated infrastructure, such as the private 5G
                                network facilitating
                                communication between vehicles and the use of smart sensors to gather
                                critical data on traffic flow. This activity highlighted the exciting challenge of
                                building
                                connected environments, where intelligent design ensures both safety and efficiency for
                                all users.

                <h2> Student exchanges </h2>
                <p> Knowing I want to improve and focus on data science, bests countries for me to do my
                    mobility are Germany and Canada : indeed, these countries are among the most advanced in this
                    sector.</p>
                <br>
                <p> I am particularly interested in TU Darmstadt as a destination for my studies because it offers
                    strong master’s programmes in areas directly aligned with my ambitions. For instance, its
                    “Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (M.Sc.)” track provides advanced courses in AI,
                    Machine Learning, and related topics I want to specialise in or discover. Moreover, the university’s
                    Data & AI research environment and its labs working on Machine Learning and data systems make
                    it an excellent place to deepen both theoretical knowledge and practical skills. By choosing
                    Darmstadt, I hope to build the strong technical foundation to pursue a future in data science or
                    maybe AI. </p>

                <p>
                    At the same time, I am interested in the Université de Sherbrooke. For me, it is an attractive
                    option because it offers
                    a Data Science program that could give me a solid base in data analysis and prepare me for global
                    opportunities. Studying abroad at Sherbrooke would also allow me to experience a different academic
                    culture and broaden my perspectives, which I believe is very valuable in a field that evolves as
                    quickly as data science.

                <p>
                    Choosing between these two : Darmstadt for its strong AI/data-science research and technical depth,
                    and Sherbrooke for an international experience and broad data-oriented education reflects my
                    ambition to grow both technically and humanly.

                    <h2> Leave with Airbus </h2>
                    <p> With Airbus, two mobility destinations are offered : Spain and Germany.
                        However, after contacting HR, I discussed the matter with my tutor, and it appears there are no
                        data science departments in those countries.
                        That's why, it would be more interesting for me to do my mobility in an another university.
