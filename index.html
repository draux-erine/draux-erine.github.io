                        After obtaining my Higher National Diploma, I joined the ENSEEIHT's Digital Science department
                        through an apprenticeship program. It represents a valuable opportunity to simultaneously deepen
                        my
                        theoretical knowledge and discover the professional world.
                        The curriculum covers various subjects : programming fundamentals, the theoretical base of data
                        science and applied mathematics and the essential concepts of system design and finally networks
                        and
                        communication.

                    <p>
                        In 2023, I enrolled in an IUT (University Institute of Technology) at the University of Toulouse
                        for
                        a program which was originally designed as a three-year Bachelor's degree (BUT). However, after
                        two
                        years, I chose to exit the program, thereby successfully obtaining the DUT (Diplôme
                        Universitaire de
                        Technologie), which is recognized internationally as a Higher National Diploma (HND) in order to
                        get
                        into ENSEEIHT. Following a generalized first year, I specialized in AGED (Administration,
                        Exploitation, and Management of Databases). While this specialization was primarily focused on
                        database administration and Data Science principles, the curriculum was structured to maintain
                        essential versatility. It included targeted courses in Networking and Development, which ensured
                        I
                        acquired a robust technical foundation while simultaneously developing skills crucial for
                        full-stack
                        data projects.

                        <p>Many subjects in the world of computer science arouse my curiosity, one of them is Big Data.
                            Indeed, I find fascinating how valuable insights we can get from massive volumes of data. I
                            had
                            the chance to start discovering this subject during my years in th UIT by cleaning and
                            re-organizing data to create PowerBI reports. It motivated me to continue on this path.
                            However,
                            big data is a large domain and currently I am discovering the world of Data Science thanks
                            to my
                            apprenticeship. I still have a lot to learn, but I am eager to discover more about it and
                            eventually improve myself on subjects such as Artificial Intelligence. </p>

                </div>
                <p>One of my key strengths is perseverance. Indeed, I always find ways to reach my goal no matter the
                    difficulty that I have to overcome. This characteristic is particularly demonstrated in the academic
                    and
                    learning environment. Let’s take for example my first year of University : it was the first time for
                    me
                    discovering the programming language ADA and focusing truly on algorithmics. It was very hard for me
                    to
                    adjust and I failed my first project and exam in this subject. However I didn’t let it get to me and
                    saw
                    this as a way to prove myself. In order to improve myself, I decided to re-do all of the TP and to
                    ask
                    for advice from my professors and classmates which led me to better understand the mechanics behind
                    this
                    subject and I finally passed the second exam. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="strenght str2">
                <div class="strenghts-left">
                    <img src="../images/collaboration.png">
                    <h2> Teamwork </h2>
                </div>
                <p>Another one of my strengths is teamwork and collaboration. This strength was particularly
                    demonstrated
                    during the “Nuit de l’Info”, a contest in which as a team we have to tackle computing challenges in
                    one
                    night. I participated in two editions : 2023 and 2024 but the most memorable for me was in 2024 in
                    terms
                    of collaboration. Indeed, we were a team of six computer science students, and in order to be
                    effective,
                    I suggested we start by brainstorming after reading the subject and the different challenges. This
                    allowed us to make sure everyone had the same understanding of the theme and to choose the
                    challenges we
                    wanted to tackle. Once done, we decided to divide the group : two of us, including me, worked on a
                    playful captcha, three other members worked on the main challenge and the challenge that seemed
                    easier
                    to us was tackled later during the night by one of the three group members. Of course, during the
                    night
                    I didn’t hesitate to ask for help when I faced difficulties and the other way around, I also helped
                    my
                    teammates and answered their questions or confusion.
                    In the end we finished first for one challenge and on the podium for another one. It proved that we
                    succeeded in working in a group and collaborating even within a short period of time and under a lot
                    of
                    pressure. </p>

                                    The purpose of this project was to clean, and analyse data of an open database:
                                    OpenFoodFact by making reports to give precise insights on nutri-score. Once done,
                                    another aim was to use Artificial Intelligence processes on Knime to determine the
                                    nutri-score of certain products. The main difficulty resided in managing a vast
                                    dataset characterized by a significant number of incomplete entries and missing
                                    values, which presented a major challenge to delivering relevant and proper
                                    analyses.

                                    My role was polyvalent throughout the project. Indeed, I actively participated in
                                    the design of the Conceptual Data Model (CDM), ensuring the data structure was
                                    optimized for our analysis. I then took the initiative to deepen my skills by
                                    handling the data cleaning and integration into the database, where I specifically
                                    performed performance tests by utilizing both Python scripts and Knime workflows.
                                    Furthermore, I was made responsible for creating the analysis reports on the impact
                                    of labels and packaging on the Nutri-Score. Facing the challenge of a large volume
                                    of incomplete entries and missing values, I demonstrated rigor and a strong
                                    problem-solving mindset by implementing strict filtering strategies to overcome the
                                    data scarcity and successfully deliver reliable and actionable insights. Finally, I
                                    collaborated in the modeling phase by using various Artificial Intelligence
                                    processes on Knime for Nutri-Score prediction. This project not only developed my
                                    technical skills but also enhanced my transversal skills, notably my autonomy when
                                    dealing with raw data, my complex problem-solving ability, and my team spirit.

                                    The project required a robust technical stack to achieve its goals. I utilized
                                    Python for scripting and data cleaning, and the visual workflow platform Knime for
                                    advanced data integration, processing, and the application of Artificial
                                    Intelligence models. The data itself was sourced from the OpenFoodFacts API,
                                    structured using the Conceptual Data Model (CDM) methodology, and managed within a
                                    PostgreSQL database. For predictive modeling, I implemented and optimized various
                                    Machine Learning algorithms, including Gradient Boosted Trees and Multi-Layer
                                    Perceptron, to predict the Nutri-Score. Finally, Power BI was used for data
                                    visualization and the creation of detailed analytical reports, translating complex
                                    findings into actionable insights.

                            The core challenge of this project was to conceive and develop a real estate management
                            application based on client expectations and specifications. The initial difficulty lay in
                            the analysis of the subject and needs, which required many exchanges with the client to
                            fully grasp the complex business rules of the real estate sector. This led to the
                            fundamental necessity of defining a clear Conceptual Data Model (CDM), which served as the
                            essential blueprint for the application's implementation.

                            The final outcome was a fully functional application developed in Java which passed all of
                            the tests scenarios given. Beyond the successful delivery of the product itself, the project
                            resulted in a significant reinforcement of my knowledge of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
                            and my ability to set up robust software architectures. A crucial element of the deliverable
                            included a comprehensive user guide to support the application's deployment.

                            After doing so, each one of us tried to use different IA processes on Knime to see if we
                            could
                            predict the nutri-score of newly added food, allowing me to discover supervised and

                            Leveraging Supervised Learning on KNIME, I implemented and evaluated robust models,

                            the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)

                            For the application's development we developed in Java (within the Eclipse IDE). We employed
                            several best practices for code structuring to ensure high maintainability and clarity. Most
                            notably, we implemented the Data Access Object (DAO) design pattern. This technical approach
                            was key to achieving a clear and clean separation between the business logic layer and the
                            underlying data management layer, allowing for a highly modular and organized codebase. We
                            also chose to follow the Model-View-Controller architecture in order to

                            The company’s redundancy system experienced data inconsistencies during server failover. The
                            main goal of this internship was therefore to enhance the system resilience. My mission
                            involved identifying and implementing a database replication solution.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This stage successfully identified two viable data replication solutions suitable for the
                            company's two-server infrastructure. The initial research and testing phase resulted in the
                            elimination of multiple incompatible tools (including specific database and synchronization
                            mechanisms), which defined the final scope of deployment. I then focused on the
                            implementation of one solution, creating the necessary Java integration code and performing
                            functional tests to confirm its ability to replicate data and maintain consistency during
                            failover events. I delivered a comprehensive technical analysis, code samples, and
                            architectural diagrams. These materials provide the internal team with the practical
                            groundwork required to deploy the chosen replication system, ensuring the coherence of
                            critical alarm data and supporting service availability.

                            My role during this three-month internship was centered on improving data consistency in the
                            redundant server environment. I was responsible for conducting the comparative study and
                            hands-on testing of various database replication solutions. After selecting the most
                            suitable mechanisms, my primary contribution involved developing the Java code for a to
                            integrate the chosen system with the existing application architecture. I ensured detailed
                            documentation of the findings and the implementation steps, delivering the technical
                            foundation for the project’s next phase.

                            This project required applying and expanding expertise across several key technologies. The
                            implementation was conducted entirely within a Linux environment, utilizing Ubuntu Virtual
                            Machines for system setup and testing. I gained hands-on experience with several database
                            technologies including MongoDB, SQLite, and Redis, and focused heavily on evaluating various
                            data replication mechanisms (Master-Replica models). The integration work involved Java
                            development (utilizing class diagrams and adhering to best practices) to interface with the
                            core application. For advanced troubleshooting, I used Wireshark for deep TCP exchange
                            analysis, and relied on application logs and tools like JConsole to monitor system behavior
                            and validate data consistency.

            <h3> Why is it important</h3>
            <p> In my opinion, the importance of CSR in engineering is significant. Indeed, CSR commitments allow us to
                step outside of our comfort zone and technical world in order to be more considerate of other factors
                such as ethical, social or environmental.
                By doing so, it allows us to build our sense of responsibility and thus to create solutions more adapted
                and relevant to the world we live in. For me, it's also what makes us more unique because each one of us
                will take part in distinct CSR commitments and experience
                it in a different way, leading to learning more about who we are and the engineer we want to become.

                            <p> The "Futurs proches" festival is an event where activities tackling different subjects
                                allowing us to collectively explore possible futures.
                                I participated twice allowing me to cover several activites. One that particularly
                                impacted
                                me was my visit to the IRIT lab. It was focused on "The Future of Mobility by NeOCampus"
                                and
                                provided a clear perspective on how intelligent systems are reshaping urban movement. I
                                observed practical demonstrations of autonomous delivery
                                robots capable of navigating complex spaces and smart public transport solutions,
                                including the development of an autonomous campus shuttle. A key takeaway was
                                understanding the
                                importance of integrated infrastructure, such as the private 5G network facilitating
                                communication
                                between vehicles and the use of smart sensors on light posts and roads to gather
                                critical data
                                on traffic flow. This activity highlighted the exciting challenge of building seamlessly
                                connected environments, where intelligent design ensures both safety and efficiency for
                                all users.
